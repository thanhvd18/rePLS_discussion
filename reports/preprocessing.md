MRI data were preprocessed using the CAT12 toolbox (built 1450 with SPM12 version 7487 and Matlab 2019a; http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat) with default parameters. Images were bias corrected, segmented using tissue classification, normalized to MNI-space using DARTEL normalization, smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian Kernel (8 mm FWHM), and resampled to 3-mm isomorphic voxels. Using the PHOTON AI software (see “Model training and validation” section below), a whole-brain mask comprising all gray matter voxels was applied, data were vectorized, features with zero variance in the GNC dataset were removed, and the scikit-learn Standard Scaler was applied.
