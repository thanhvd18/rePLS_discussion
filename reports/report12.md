## 1. Results


### Explain results
Questions:
- Are the results consistent between folds? What is main difference/common in results between folds?
- Compare results between components? 
- Explain why low/high value in P,PQ?

To answer these questions, I analyse in 2 views: Brain space view and Feature view

**Brain space view**


**Feature view**

$P \in \mathbb{152 \times 5 }$ (152 regions, 5 components) in fold 0

fold 1

fold 2

$PQ \in \mathbb{152 \times 8}$ (152 regions, 8 outputs) in fold 0
